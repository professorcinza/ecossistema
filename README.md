# V FOR X

**An indestructible, decentralized, anonymous-first web platform for exposing corruption, routing resources, and sharing survival knowledge.**

Cyberpunk terminal aesthetic. Fully static. No backend. No tracking. Works offline.

People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.

---

## What It Is

V for X is not a tool — it's a transition phase. A platform where ordinary people can **see** the problem, **understand** the solution, **act** on it, **hold** the powerful accountable, **coordinate** anonymously, and **protect** themselves while doing so.

The 9 branches form a connected loop:

```
    ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

## Design System

Strict cyberpunk terminal aesthetic — every pixel obeys:

- **Pure black** backgrounds (#000 / #0a0a0a), no light themes
- **Blood-red** accents (#cc0000), terminal green only for verified states (#00ff41)
- **Monospace** typography throughout (JetBrains Mono / Fira Code / system mono)
- **Scanlines**, CRT vignette, film grain, flicker effects
- **Glitch** text (RGB chromatic aberration on hover)
- **Typewriter** effect on hero text and headers
- **Sharp corners** everywhere (border-radius: 0), brutalist
- **Procedural sound** — keystroke clicks, nav beeps, static bursts (off by default)
- **prefers-reduced-motion** respected — disables all animations
- **Mobile responsive** — effects reduce intensity on small screens
- **Print mode** — Protocol X blueprints strip all effects for physical distribution

---

## On-device Semantic Oracle

The Oracle (`/the-oracle/`) answers plain-English questions over the 200×28 data matrix. It runs **two engines**, both fully on-device:

- **Exact** — instant heuristic pattern matching for threshold/rank queries (`"hunger > 30%"`, `"top 10 by military"`).
- **Semantic** — a small transformer model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, ~23 MB) loaded via [transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js), running in-browser on **WebGPU** (or WASM fallback). It embeds every country's crisis profile and every metric into a vector index, then answers *conceptual* questions that keywords cannot:

> *"Which countries are most likely to tip into famine next year?"*

The semantic ranker blends two on-device signals: a direction-normalized **composite** crisis score weighted by the metrics most relevant to the query (80%), plus direct **query↔country semantic similarity** (20%). Every result shows its top contributing dimensions for explainability.

**Privacy by design.** The model and its WASM runtime are public open-source artifacts fetched once and cached locally forever. Every query is embedded on-device and compared against the local index — **nothing about your questions ever leaves the browser.** This is the platform's most defensible differentiator: real natural-language understanding that never phones home.

The computed 200-country + metric vector index is persisted in IndexedDB (keyed by model + data version), so repeat visits are instantly ready.

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `lib/semantic-oracle.ts` | Pure vector math, normalization, scoring, ranking (model-agnostic, fully unit-tested) |
| `lib/embeddings.ts` | Runtime loader for transformers.js (WebGPU/WASM, progress, caching) |
| `app/the-oracle/page.tsx` | Dual-engine UI with graceful fallback + privacy panel |
| `tests/semantic-oracle.test.ts` | 24 tests covering math, normalization, and end-to-end ranking on real data |

---

## Build & Run

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/mouracleiton/v_for_x.git
cd v_for_x

# Install
npm install

# Develop
npm run dev

# Build static export
npm run build

# Serve locally
npx serve out/
```

The build produces 231 static HTML pages in `out/`. No server required. Deploy to any static host (GitHub Pages, IPFS, USB drive).

---

## The Mirror — one-command deployment kit

Fortress documents self-hosting; **The Mirror automates it.** A single command
pulls the latest static build, pins it to IPFS, and stands up a censorship-
resistant node in under five minutes.

```bash
# One command → a live mirror (clearnet, .onion, IPFS, Pi, USB)
curl -fsSL https://vforx.org/mirror/install.sh | bash -s -- --tor --pin-ipfs
```

The kit (`/mirror/`) ships a Docker image, a `docker-compose` stack (web + kubo
IPFS + Tor), a `cloud-init.yaml` for cloud VMs, a Raspberry Pi installer, and a
build-manifest tool that produces a SHA-256 root hash bound to every badge.

Each operator mints a signed **"I mirrored this" badge** (ECDSA P-256, fully
client-side) that feeds a **distributed, serverless node list** — merge lists
peer-to-peer via The Web or dead drops. There is no central registry.

→ **[/the-mirror/](app/the-mirror/page.tsx)** — the in-app kit page + badge generator
→ **[mirror/](mirror/)** — the deployment artifacts

## Key Features

- **231 static pages** generated at build time (200 country detail pages + 12 blueprints + 5 dossiers + 9 branch pages + 2 new routes)
- **Zero external API calls** at runtime — all data is bundled
- **On-device semantic AI** — a transformer model runs in your browser (WebGPU/WASM) to answer conceptual natural-language questions about the data; queries never leave the device
- **Zero tracking** — no analytics, no cookies, no third-party scripts
- **Zero API keys** — Leaflet uses bundled GeoJSON, no Mapbox/Google token
- **Offline-capable** — works from a USB drive with no internet
- **Anonymous by design** — identity is a client-side ECDSA keypair, no registration
- **Decentralized-ready** — static export can be mirrored on IPFS, Tor, or local mesh
- **Stubs clearly marked** — every [STUB] feature has a visible badge and documented upgrade path
- **Signed data manifest** — every build hashes its public data API files (205 entries, deterministic root); the Receipts page verifies any copy locally, so tampered mirrors are detectable with zero network trust
- **Browser-to-browser signaling** — The Web pairs peers via VFXSIG tokens over clipboard/BroadcastChannel/hash links, no server in the path
- **Extension alert ticker** — the V FOR X Compass add-on polls a tiny generated feed and raises badge/notifications only when the watchlist actually changes
- **Dead man's switch auto-release** — the Guardian's armed ladder fires by itself at the missed deadline: builds the ECDSA-signed release packet, copies the token to the clipboard, and surfaces it for trusted contacts; duress/panic release immediately
- **Chunked encrypted file transfer** — The Web ships files over the live peer channel (VFXFILE1), per-chunk AES-GCM, SHA-256 verified on arrival; received files can be planted as encrypted dead drops
- **Mesh store-and-forward** — offline mail rides the peer mesh: queued in IndexedDB, flushed when peers meet, TTL-expired, hop-capped to 5
- **Collaborative documents (The Docs)** — offline-first conflict-free text docs built on a from-scratch RGA CRDT (no yjs/automerge); sync by copy, paste, or BroadcastChannel; concurrent edits always converge
- **Evidence Room (Registry)** — hash-chain evidence bundles sealed per dossier, verifiable offline (VFXEV1), optional ZK commitment of custody
- **Public Witness Ledger (The Receipts)** — signed, hash-chained public statements (VFXWIT1), exportable/importable, signature proves authorship without a name
- **Mirror Ring (/the-mirror-ring)** — verified mirror directory: paste a VFXM1: claim token, verify the signature locally, swap hosts with one click, share the ring as a text block
- **Offline Briefcase (Fortress)** — one tap crawls the whole static platform into the service-worker cache with live progress; the site then runs with zero connectivity
- **Polyglot Oracle** — the on-device semantic model is now selectable: fast English (23 MB) or the multilingual MiniLM-L12 (~118 MB quantized) covering 50+ languages; inference and indexing still stay in the browser
- **12 languages, 3 RTL** — Persian (فارسی) and Urdu (اردو) join Arabic as full right-to-left layouts with dir-aware CSS
- **Glitch Cards** — every ShareableStat can render as a downloadable 1200×630 PNG glitch card (canvas-drawn, zero server, zero libraries)
